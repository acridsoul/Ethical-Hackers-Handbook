- A buffer is a region of physical memory storage used to temporarily store data while it is being moved from one place to another.
- A buffer overflow attack is a type of cybersecurity exploit where an attacker overflows a buffer (a temporary storage area in a computer's memory) with more data than it can hold. 
- This overflow can overwrite adjacent memory locations, which can lead to various malicious outcomes, including:
    1. Code Execution: By overwriting the return address of a function with the address of malicious code, an attacker can execute arbitrary code on the target system. This is one of the most dangerous types of buffer overflow attacks.
    2. Information Disclosure: Overwriting the memory of other programs or system processes can lead to the disclosure of sensitive information, such as passwords or encryption keys.
    3. Denial of Service (DoS): By causing a program to crash or become unresponsive due to corrupted memory, an attacker can disrupt the service provided by the program.
    4. Privilege Escalation: If the overwritten memory belongs to a privileged process or user, the attacker might gain elevated privileges on the system.
    5. Data Corruption: The excess data can overwrite adjacent memory locations, potentially corrupting data stored there.
    6. Program Crashes: If the overflow affects critical program data or code, it can cause the program to crash.


### How Buffer Overflow Attacks Work
- Buffer overflow attacks typically occur when a program writes more data to a buffer than it can hold. This can happen due to several reasons:
    1. Incorrectly Calculated Buffer Sizes: If the program does not correctly calculate the size of the data being written to a buffer, it might write beyond the allocated space.
    2. Lack of Input Validation: If the program does not validate or sanitize user input, an attacker can provide input that exceeds the buffer size.
    3. Insecure Coding Practices: Using functions that do not check the size of the destination buffer, such as strcpy without a maximum length, can lead to buffer overflow vulnerabilities.

- Buffer overflow attacks are a significant security concern, especially for systems running critical infrastructure or handling sensitive data.
