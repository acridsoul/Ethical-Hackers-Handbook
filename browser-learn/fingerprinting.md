# **Browser Fingerprinting**

* It identifies users uniquely and their associate sessions regardless of anonymizing tactics like incognito browsing, VPNs, and cookie blockers.
* Unlike deleting cookies, a user cannot change their browser fingerprint.
* Fingerprinting can identify trends of malicious behavior and block you next time.

## Data taken through fingerprinting:

- Fingerprinting doesnt need your ip address or cookie to identify you:
- **It uses these identifiers:**

* Computer make and model
* Operating system version
* Browser version
* Browser extensions
* Timezone
* Language settings
* Adblocker used
* Screen size and resolution
* Tech specs (CPU, GPU, hard disk, etc.)
