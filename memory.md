- Computer memory is an electronic mechanism that has the ability to store and retrieve data.
- The smallest amount of data that can be stored is 1 bit, which can be represented by either a 1 or a 0 in memory
- When you put 4 `bits` together, it is called a `nibble` which can represent values from `0000 to -11111`
- 8 bits equals a `byte` which can represent `0 - 255 in decimal` or `0 to (2^8 - 1)`
- When we put two `bytes` together we get a `word` which is `0 - 65,535 in decimal` 0r `0 to (2^16 - 1)`
- The size of a word can vary depending on the architecture of the computer system, but it is commonly 4 bytes (32 bits) on many modern systems,    especially those based on the x86 architecture.
